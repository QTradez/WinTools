# Scripts for Changing Windows virtual desktops by clicking in the taskbar.

Since I use a lot of Remote systems that have virtual desktops, I need a way to easily change Virtual desktops on the remote system without changing the one on the local system.

These scripts and shortcut allow you to put shortcuts in the taskbar and click to change Virtual desktops.

Started with PowerShell.  Although these worked they put up Cmd windows and were a little slow.

AutoHotKey offered a solution that was fast and clean.  Shortcuts were built that launch AHK with the script as input so these can be placed in the taskbar and launched with one click.
